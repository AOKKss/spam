It may take you twice as long you may have take courses and classes you might not read as fast you might not move as quick you may not have as much but don’t you quit. If you lay dead even the animals won’t bite you. The risk of being bitten is the cost of getting up. And you have to decide are you so concerned about being bitten that you’re willing to spend the rest of your life laying dead or there is something pumping down inside of you that’s saying bit me or not I’m getting up. I’m gonna be the best me. I’m gonna do all I can do I’m going for it..`);
